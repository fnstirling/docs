## Artificial Intelligence

**<u>Artificial Intelligence</u>**

Artificial Intelligence is the concept of imitating human behaviour. It is used to build tools, agents, bots, and robots that can predict human behavior & act on a human basis. Tesla’s auto-driving cars, Amazon’s Alexa, and Siri are all examples of Artificial intelligence.

In a nutshell, Artificial Intelligence is the science of computers copying human behavior.

There are three common levels:

First, Artificial Narrow Intelligence (ANI) is designed to perform singular tasks & is goal-oriented. ANI is very capable of completing specific tasks it is programmed to do. A few examples of ANI are voice assistants, facial recognition, or driving a car.

Second, Artificial General Intelligence (AGI) is the concept of a machine with general intelligence that can mimic human intelligence and behaviors, with the ability to learn from data and apply its intelligence to solve any problem. Artificial General Intelligence can think, understand, and act in a somewhat similar way to a human in any given situation.

Artificial Superintelligence (ASI) is where machines can become self-aware and surpass human ability and intelligence.

**<u>Machine Learning</u>**

Machine Learning is a subset of Artificial Intelligence that teaches a machine to learn from previous outcomes.

Machine learning models look for patterns in the data and try to conclude outcomes that humans would. Once the algorithm gets really good at drawing outcomes, it starts applying the knowledge to the new data sets and keeps improving.

In a nutshell Machine Learning is the method behind how machines learn from data.

There are different types of Machine Learning:

Supervised Learning is when a large amount of labeled data is fed to the algorithms, and variables that the algorithm needs to assess for correlations are also defined. Supervised learning requires a vast pool of data to master the tasks.

Unsupervised Learning helps the algorithm look for patterns and data sets that don’t have labeled responses. You would use this technique to explore your data but don’t yet have a specific goal. The algorithm scans the data sets and starts segregating data into groups based on characteristics they share.

The mix of supervised & unsupervised learning is called semi-supervised learning. In semi-supervised learning mostly labeled data is fed to an algorithm, yet the model is free to explore & develop its own understanding of the data set.

Reinforcement learning is teaching a machine to complete a multi-step process with clearly defined rules. The algorithm takes its own decisions along the way & gets rewards or penalties for the actions it takes

**<u>Deep Learning</u>**

It would not be an exaggeration to say that deep learning is a technique for implementing Machine Learning. Deep Learning is a subset of machine learning that uses deep neural networks and imitates the network of neurons in a brain, and allows machines to make accurate decisions without humans’ help.

However, deep learning is sometimes seen as an evolution of machine learning. The depth of a model is represented by the number of layers it has. Deep learning is the new state of the art in terms of Artificial Intelligence. In deep learning, the training is done through a neural network.

Deep learning has empowered many practical applications in Artificial Intelligence. Self-driving cars, better healthcare, even better product recommendations are all here today or on the horizon.

## Advertising

**<u>Demand-side platform (DSP)</u>**

An DSP is a piece of software that is used to buy advertising through automation. They are most commonly used by advertisers and agencies to purchase display, video, mobile and search ads.

**<u>Supply-side platform (SSP)</u>**

An SSP is a piece of software that is used to automate the selling of advertising. They are most commonly used by advertisers and agencies to sell display, video, mobile and search ads.

## Data

**<u>Change data capture (CDC)</u>**

In databases, change data capture is a set of software design patterns used to determine and track the data that has changed so that action can be taken using changed data.

CDC is an approach to data integration that is based on the identification, capture and deliver of the changes made to enterprise data sources.

**<u>Data management platform (DMP)</u>**

A DMP is a warehouse(s) that accumulates, stores and arranges data in a way that is useful for marketing, publishing and business purposes.

## Programing

**<u>Imperative programming</u>**

In computer science, imperative programming is a programming paradigm that uses statements that change a program's state. In much the same way that
the imperative mood in natural languages expresses commands, an imperative program consists of commands for the computer to perform. Imperative
programming focuses on describing how a program operates.

The term is often used in contrast to declarative programming, which focuses on what the program should accomplish without specifying how the program
should achieve the result.

**<u>Declarative programming</u>**

In computer science, declarative programming is a programming paradigm—a style of building the structure and elements of computer programs—that
expresses the logic of a computation without describing its control flow.

Many languages that apply this style attempt to minimize or eliminate side effects by describing what the program must accomplish in terms of the
problem domain, rather than describe how to accomplish it as a sequence of the programming language primitives (the how being left up to the
language's implementation). This is in contrast with imperative programming, which implements algorithms in explicit steps.

Declarative programming often considers programs as theories of a formal logic, and computations as deductions in that logic space. Declarative
programming may greatly simplify writing parallel programs.

Common declarative languages include those of database query languages (e.g., SQL, XQuery), regular expressions, logic programming, functional
programming, and configuration management systems.

**<u>Functional programming</u>**

In computer science, functional programming is a programming paradigm where programs are constructed by applying and composing functions. It is a
declarative programming paradigm in which function definitions are trees of expressions that map values to other values, rather than a sequence of
imperative statements which update the running state of the program.

In functional programming, functions are treated as first-class citizens, meaning that they can be bound to names (
including local identifiers), passed as arguments, and returned from other functions, just as any other data type can. This allows programs to be
written in a declarative and composable style, where small functions are combined in a modular manner.

Functional programming is sometimes treated as synonymous with purely functional programming, a subset of functional programming which treats all
functions as deterministic mathematical functions, or pure functions. When a pure function is called with some given arguments, it will always return
the same result, and cannot be affected by any mutable state or other side effects. This is in contrast with impure procedures, common in imperative
programming, which can have side effects (such as modifying the program's state or taking input from a user). Proponents of purely functional
programming claim that by restricting side effects, programs can have fewer bugs, be easier to debug and test, and be more suited to formal
verification.

**<u>Singleton pattern</u>**

In software engineering, the singleton pattern is a software design pattern that restricts the instantiation of a class to one "single" instance. This
is useful when exactly one object is needed to coordinate actions across the system. The term comes from the mathematical concept of a singleton.
