### Computer programming

**unit testing** is a software testing method by which individual units of source code—sets of one or more computer
program modules together with associated control data, usage procedures, and operating procedures—are tested to
determine whether they are fit for use. Unit tests are typically automated tests written and run by software developers
to ensure that a section of an application (known as the "unit") meets its design and behaves as intended. To isolate
issues that may arise, each test case should be tested independently. The goal of unit testing is to isolate each part
of the program and show that the individual parts are correct. A unit test provides a strict, written contract that
the piece of code must satisfy. [Learn more](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unit_testing)
